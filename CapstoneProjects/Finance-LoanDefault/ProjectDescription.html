Problem Statement

Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates.
The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.

There is 1 dataset data that have 41 attributes.
You are required to determine and examine factors that affected the ratio of vehicle loan defaulters. Also, use the findings to create a model to predict the potential defaulters.

Approach:

1. Data Preliminary analysis:

Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as to the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
Variable names in the data may not be in accordance with the identifier naming in Python. Change the variable names accordingly.
The presented data might also contain missing values, therefore exploration will also lead to devising strategies to fill in the missing values. Devise strategies to do so whilst exploring the data.
2. Performing EDA:

Provide the statistical description of the quantitative data variables
How is the target variable distributed overall?
Study the distribution of the target variable across the various categories such as branch, city, state, branch, supplier, manufacturer, etc. What are the different employment types given in the data? Can a strategy be developed to fill in the missing values (if any)? Use pie charts to express how different types of employment defines defaulter and non-defaulters.
Has age got something to do with defaulting? What is the distribution of age w.r.t. to defaulters and non-defaulters?
What type of ID was presented by most of the customers as proof?
Explain the factors in the data that may have an effect on ratings e.g. No. of cuisines, cost, delivery option, etc.
